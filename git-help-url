Switching remote URLs from SSH to HTTPS

    Open Terminal (for Mac users) or the command prompt (for Windows and Linux users).

    Change the current working directory to your local project.

    List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.

    git remote -v
    # origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
    # origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)

    Change your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the remote set-url command.

    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git

    Verify that the remote URL has changed.

    git remote -v
    # Verify new remote URL
    # origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git (fetch)
    # origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git (push)
